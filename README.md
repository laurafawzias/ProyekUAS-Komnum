## Theory Behind Adaptive Noise Cancellation 🔉

Adaptive noise cancellation is a sophisticated signal processing technique that removes unwanted noise from desired signals. The system functions as an intelligent audio filter that learns and adapts in real-time.

The system works with three key components:
- **Primary input**: The signal containing desired information + noise
- **Reference input**: A signal correlated with the noise component  
- **Adaptive filter**: The core processing unit that automatically adjusts its coefficients to minimize error

#### How It Works
1. 🎯 Reference signal gets processed through the adaptive filter
2. ➖ Filter output is subtracted from the primary input
3. 📊 The resulting error is used to update filter coefficients
4. 🔄 Process continues until error is minimized

## The LMS Algorithm 📐

The **Least Mean Squares** algorithm is the heart of our adaptive system. It provides elegant, robust, and computationally efficient performance ideal for real-time applications.

### Mathematical Foundation:

The LMS algorithm uses the steepest descent method to minimize the mean square error. The key equations are:

**Filter Output:**
$$y(n) = \mathbf{w}^T(n) \mathbf{x}(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} w_i(n) x(n-i)$$

**Error Signal:**
$$e(n) = d(n) - y(n)$$

**Weight Update (LMS Algorithm):**
$$\mathbf{w}(n+1) = \mathbf{w}(n) + \mu e(n) \mathbf{x}(n)$$

**Component-wise Weight Update:**
$$w_i(n+1) = w_i(n) + \mu e(n) x(n-i), \quad i = 0, 1, ..., M-1$$

**Where:**
- $\mathbf{w}(n) = [w_0(n), w_1(n), ..., w_{M-1}(n)]^T$ : filter coefficient vector at iteration n
- $\mathbf{x}(n) = [x(n), x(n-1), ..., x(n-M+1)]^T$ : reference input vector
- $\mu$ : learning rate (step size), $0 < \mu < \frac{2}{\lambda_{max}}$
- $e(n)$ : error signal at time n
- $d(n)$ : desired signal (primary input)
- $y(n)$ : filter output
- $M$ : filter length (number of coefficients)
- $\lambda_{max}$ : maximum eigenvalue of the input correlation matrix

### Key Parameters:
- **μ (mu)**: Controls convergence speed and stability
- **Filter length**: Number of filter coefficients (determines complexity)

## Implementation Details

### `adaptive_lms.c` - The Main Engine 🚀
Our C implementation features:
- **Learning rate (μ)**: 0.01 (carefully tuned for optimal performance)
- **Filter length**: 32 coefficients (optimal for this application)
- **Input data**: Loaded from `input.csv` containing desired + reference signals
- **Output**: Generates `output_signal.txt` with desired, output, and error signals

### `plot_lms.py` - The Visualizer ✨
Python script that creates professional visualizations:
1. **Desired vs Output comparison** - Performance evaluation of the filter
2. **Zoomed output view** - Detailed analysis of the filtered signal
3. **Error signal plot** - Algorithm learning and convergence monitoring
